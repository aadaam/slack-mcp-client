## Overview

This project implements a Slack bot client that acts as a bridge between Slack and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. It uses Slack as a user interface while enabling LLM models to communicate with various MCP servers through standardized MCP tools.

Important distinction: This client is not designed to interact with the Slack API directly as its primary purpose. However, it can achieve Slack API functionality by connecting to a dedicated Slack MCP server (such as [modelcontextprotocol/servers/slack](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/slack)) alongside other MCP servers.

## How It Works

### RAG Setup and Usage

The client includes an improved RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system that's compatible with LangChain Go and provides professional-grade performance:

#### Quick Start with RAG

1. **Enable RAG in your configuration:**

```json
{
  "llm_provider": "openai",
  "llm_providers": {
    "openai": {
      "type": "openai", 
      "model": "gpt-4o",
      "rag_config": {
        "enabled": true,
        "provider": "json",
        "database_path": "./knowledge.json",
        "chunk_size": 1000,
        "chunk_overlap": 200,
        "max_results": 10
      }
    }
  }
}
```

2. **Ingest documents using CLI:**

```bash
# Ingest PDF files from a directory
slack-mcp-client --rag-ingest ./company-docs --rag-db ./knowledge.json

# Test search functionality
slack-mcp-client --rag-search "vacation policy" --rag-db ./knowledge.json

# Get database statistics
slack-mcp-client --rag-stats --rag-db ./knowledge.json
```

3. **Use in Slack:**

Once configured, the LLM can automatically search your knowledge base:

**User**: "What's our vacation policy?"

**AI**: "Let me search our knowledge base for vacation policy information..."
*(Automatically searches RAG database)*

**AI**: "Based on our company policy documents, you get 15 days of vacation..."

#### RAG Features

- **ðŸŽ¯ Smart Search**: Advanced relevance scoring with word frequency, filename boosting, and phrase matching
- **ðŸ”— LangChain Compatible**: Drop-in replacement for standard vector stores
- **ðŸ“ˆ Extensible**: Easy to add vector embeddings and other backends

### Custom Prompts and Assistants

The client supports advanced prompt engineering capabilities for creating specialized AI assistants:

#### System Prompts

Create custom AI personalities and behaviors:

```bash
# Create a custom system prompt file
cat > sales-assistant.txt << EOL
You are SalesGPT, a helpful sales assistant specializing in B2B software sales.

Your expertise includes:
- Lead qualification and discovery
- Solution positioning and value propositions  
- Objection handling and negotiation
- CRM best practices and sales processes

Always:
- Ask qualifying questions to understand prospect needs

When discussing pricing, always emphasize value over cost.
EOL

# Use the custom prompt
slack-mcp-client --system-prompt ./sales-assistant.txt
```

#### Configuration-Based Prompts

Define prompts in your configuration:

```json
{
  "llm_provider": "openai",
  "llm_providers": {
    "openai": {
      "type": "openai",
      "model": "gpt-4o",
      "system_prompt": "You are a helpful DevOps assistant specializing in Kubernetes and cloud infrastructure.",
      "conversation_starters": [
        "Help me debug a Kubernetes pod issue",
        "Explain best practices for CI/CD pipelines", 
        "Review my Dockerfile for optimization"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Assistant Roles

Create specialized assistants for different use cases:

- **DevOps Assistant**: Kubernetes, Docker, CI/CD expertise
- **Sales Assistant**: Lead qualification, objection handling
- **HR Assistant**: Policy questions, onboarding guidance
- **Support Assistant**: Customer issue resolution
- **Code Review Assistant**: Security, performance, best practices

### Agent Mode

Agent Mode enables more interactive and context-aware conversations using LangChain's agent framework. Instead of single-prompt interactions, agents can engage in multi-step reasoning, use tools more strategically, and maintain better context throughout conversations.

#### How Agent Mode Works

Agent Mode uses LangChain's conversational agent framework to provide:

1. **Interactive Conversations**: Maintains context across multiple exchanges
2. **Strategic Tool Usage**: Agents decide when and how to use available tools
3. **Multi-Step Reasoning**: Can break down complex problems into manageable steps
4. **Streaming Responses**: Provides real-time updates during processing
5. **User Context Integration**: Incorporates user information for personalized responses

#### Agent Mode Configuration

Enable Agent Mode in your configuration file:

```json
{
  "use_agent": true,
  "use_native_tools": false,
  "custom_prompt": "You are a DevOps expert specializing in Kubernetes and cloud infrastructure. Always think through problems step by step.",
  "llm_provider": "langchain",
  "llm_providers": {
    "langchain": {
      "type": "openai",
      "model": "gpt-4o",
      "agent_prompt_prefix": "You are a helpful assistant with access to various tools."
    }
  },
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/project"]
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "github-mcp-server",
      "args": ["stdio"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Configuration Options

- **`use_agent`**: Enable agent mode (default: false)
- **`use_native_tools`**: Use native LangChain tools vs system prompt-based tools (default: false)
- **`agent_prompt_prefix`**: Custom prompt prefix for agent initialization
- **`custom_prompt`**: System prompt for agent behavior

#### Agent vs Standard Mode

**Standard Mode**:
- Single-prompt interactions
- Tools described in system prompt as JSON schemas
- Direct tool call parsing and execution
- More predictable token usage
- Simpler conversation flow

**Agent Mode**:
- Multi-turn conversational interactions
- Context-aware tool usage decisions
- Better user context integration
- More natural conversation flow
- Enhanced reasoning capabilities

#### Agent Mode Examples

**Interactive Development Consultation**:
```
User: "I need help optimizing my React app performance"

Agent Response:
ðŸ¤– I'd be happy to help optimize your React app performance! Let me understand your current setup better.

[Agent maintains conversation context and asks relevant follow-up questions]
Agent: "What specific performance issues are you experiencing? Are you seeing slow renders, large bundle sizes, or something else?"

User: "The app takes too long to load initially"

Agent: "Let me check your current bundle setup and suggest optimizations..."
[Agent uses filesystem tools to analyze the project structure and provides targeted advice]
```

**Contextual Problem Solving**:
```
User: "Can you help me with my deployment pipeline?"

Agent Response:
ðŸ¤– I'll help you with your deployment pipeline. Since I know you're working on a React project, let me check your current CI/CD setup.

[Agent leverages previous conversation context and user information to provide personalized assistance]
[Agent strategically uses relevant tools based on the conversation flow]
```

#### Agent Mode Best Practices

1. **System Prompts**: Design clear, specific system prompts that guide the agent's behavior
2. **Tool Selection**: Provide relevant tools for the agent's domain
3. **Context Management**: Agents maintain better context across conversations
4. **User Personalization**: Leverage user context integration for personalized responses
5. **Tool Strategy**: Choose between native tools or system prompt-based tools based on your needs

#### Limitations and Considerations

- **OpenAI Agent**: Native OpenAI agent in langchaingo has known issues, uses conversational agent as workaround
- **LangChain Dependency**: Agent mode requires LangChain provider
- **Permissions**: May require additional Slack permissions for user information retrieval
- **Performance**: Agent mode may have different performance characteristics than standard mode

### Kubernetes Deployment with Helm

For deploying to Kubernetes, a Helm chart is available in the `helm-chart` directory. This chart provides a flexible way to deploy the slack-mcp-client with proper configuration and secret management.

#### Installing from GitHub Container Registry

The Helm chart is also available directly from GitHub Container Registry, allowing for easier installation without needing to clone the repository:

```bash
# Add the OCI repository to Helm (only needed once)
helm registry login ghcr.io -u USERNAME -p GITHUB_TOKEN

# Pull the Helm chart
helm pull oci://ghcr.io/tuannvm/charts/slack-mcp-client --version 0.1.0

# Or install directly
helm install my-slack-bot oci://ghcr.io/tuannvm/charts/slack-mcp-client --version 0.1.0 -f values.yaml
```

You can check available versions by visiting the GitHub Container Registry in your browser.

#### Prerequisites
- Kubernetes 1.16+
- Helm 3.0+
- Slack Bot and App tokens

#### Basic Installation

```bash
# Create a values file with your configuration
cat > values.yaml << EOL
secret:
  create: true

env:
  SLACK_BOT_TOKEN: "xoxb-your-bot-token"
  SLACK_APP_TOKEN: "xapp-your-app-token"
  OPENAI_API_KEY: "sk-your-openai-key"
  OPENAI_MODEL: "gpt-4o"
  LOG_LEVEL: "info"

# Optional: Configure MCP servers
configMap:
  create: true
EOL

# Install the chart
helm install my-slack-bot ./helm-chart/slack-mcp-client -f values.yaml
```

#### Configuration Options

The Helm chart supports various configuration options including:
- Setting resource limits and requests
- Configuring MCP servers via ConfigMap
- Managing sensitive data via Kubernetes secrets
- Customizing deployment parameters

For more details, see the [Helm chart README](helm-chart/slack-mcp-client/README.md).

#### Using the Docker Image from GHCR

The Helm chart uses the Docker image from GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) by default. You can specify a particular version or use the latest tag:

```yaml
# In your values.yaml
image:
  repository: ghcr.io/tuannvm/slack-mcp-client
  tag: "latest"  # Or use a specific version like "1.0.0"
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
```

To manually pull the image:

```bash
# Pull the latest image
docker pull ghcr.io/tuannvm/slack-mcp-client:latest

# Or pull a specific version
docker pull ghcr.io/tuannvm/slack-mcp-client:1.0.0
```

If you're using private images, you can configure image pull secrets in your values:

```yaml
imagePullSecrets:
  - name: my-ghcr-secret
```

### Docker Compose for Local Testing

For local testing and development, you can use Docker Compose to easily run the slack-mcp-client along with additional MCP servers.

#### Setup

1. Create a `.env` file with your credentials:

```bash
# Create .env file from example
cp .env.example .env
# Edit the file with your credentials
nano .env
```

2. Create a `mcp-servers.json` file (or use the example):

```bash
# Create mcp-servers.json from example
cp mcp-servers.json.example mcp-servers.json
# Edit if needed
nano mcp-servers.json
```

3. Start the services:

```bash
# Start services in detached mode
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop services
docker-compose down
```

#### Docker Compose Configuration

The included `docker-compose.yml` provides:

- Environment variables loaded from `.env` file
- Volume mounting for MCP server configuration
- Examples of connecting to additional MCP servers (commented out)

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  slack-mcp-client:
    image: ghcr.io/tuannvm/slack-mcp-client:latest
    container_name: slack-mcp-client
    environment:
      - SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=${SLACK_BOT_TOKEN}
      - SLACK_APP_TOKEN=${SLACK_APP_TOKEN}
      - OPENAI_API_KEY=${OPENAI_API_KEY}
      - OPENAI_MODEL=${OPENAI_MODEL:-gpt-4o}

## LLM Integration

The client supports multiple LLM providers through a flexible integration system:

### LangChain Gateway

The LangChain gateway enables seamless integration with various LLM providers:

- **OpenAI**: Native support for GPT models (default)
- **Ollama**: Local LLM support for models like Llama, Mistral, etc.
- **Extensible**: Can be extended to support other LangChain-compatible providers

### LLM-MCP Bridge

The custom LLM-MCP bridge layer enables any LLM to use MCP tools without requiring native function-calling capabilities:

- **Universal Compatibility**: Works with any LLM, including those without function-calling
- **Pattern Recognition**: Detects when a user prompt or LLM response should trigger a tool call
- **Natural Language Support**: Understands both structured JSON tool calls and natural language requests

### Configuration

LLM providers can be configured via environment variables or command-line flags:

```bash
# Set OpenAI as the provider (default)
export LLM_PROVIDER="openai"
export OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4o"

# Use Anthropic
export LLM_PROVIDER="anthropic"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-api-key"
export ANTHROPIC_MODEL="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"

# Or use Ollama
export LLM_PROVIDER="ollama"
export LANGCHAIN_OLLAMA_URL="http://localhost:11434"
export LANGCHAIN_OLLAMA_MODEL="llama3"
```

### Switching Between Providers

You can easily switch between providers by changing the `LLM_PROVIDER` environment variable:

```bash
# Use OpenAI
export LLM_PROVIDER=openai

# Use Anthropic
export LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic

# Use Ollama (local)
export LLM_PROVIDER=ollama
```

## Configuration

The client uses two main configuration approaches:

### Environment Variables

      "initialize_timeout_seconds": 30
    }
  }
}
```

For detailed configuration options, see the [Implementation Notes](docs/implementation.md).

## Slack-Formatted Output

The client includes a comprehensive Slack-formatted output system that enhances message display in Slack:

- **Automatic Format Detection**: Automatically detects message type (plain text, markdown, JSON Block Kit, structured data) and applies appropriate formatting
- **Markdown Formatting**: Supports Slack's mrkdwn syntax with automatic conversion from standard Markdown
  - Converts `**bold**` to `*bold*` for proper Slack bold formatting
  - Preserves inline code, block quotes, lists, and other formatting elements
- **Quoted String Enhancement**: Automatically converts double-quoted strings to inline code blocks for better visualization
  - Example: `"namespace-name"` becomes `` `namespace-name` `` in Slack
  - Improves readability of IDs, timestamps, and other quoted values
- **Block Kit Integration**: Converts structured data to Block Kit layouts for better visual presentation
  - Automatically validates against Slack API limits
  - Falls back to plain text if Block Kit validation fails

For more details, see the [Slack Formatting Guide](docs/format.md).

## Transport Modes

The client supports three transport modes:

- **SSE (default)**: Uses Server-Sent Events for real-time communication with the MCP server, includes automatic retry logic for enhanced reliability
- **HTTP**: Uses HTTP POST requests with JSON-RPC for communication
- **stdio**: Uses standard input/output for local development and testing

## CI/CD and Releases

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and GoReleaser for automated releases.

### Continuous Integration Checks

Our CI pipeline performs the following checks on all PRs and commits to the main branch:

#### Code Quality
- **Linting**: Using golangci-lint to check for common code issues and style violations
- **Go Module Verification**: Ensuring go.mod and go.sum are properly maintained
- **Formatting**: Verifying code is properly formatted with gofmt

#### Security
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Using govulncheck to check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Dependency Scanning**: Using Trivy to scan for vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **SBOM Generation**: Creating a Software Bill of Materials for dependency tracking

#### Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Running tests with race detection and code coverage reporting
- **Build Verification**: Ensuring the codebase builds successfully

### Release Process

When changes are merged to the main branch:
1. CI checks are run to validate code quality and security
2. If successful, a new release is automatically created with:
   - Semantic versioning based on commit messages
   - Binary builds for multiple platforms
   - Docker image publishing to GitHub Container Registry
   - Helm chart publishing to GitHub Container Registry
